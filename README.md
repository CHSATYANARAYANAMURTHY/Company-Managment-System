Company Management System (CMS)

The Company Management System is a robust web application developed using Java Server Pages (JSP) and Servlets to enhance the management processes within an organization. This system provides a user-friendly and efficient platform for managing various aspects of the business, such as employee data, projects, tasks, and resource allocation.

Employee Management: The human resources department can maintain comprehensive records of employees, including personal information, contact details, employment history, and performance reviews. It also supports employee onboarding and exiting processes.

Project and Task Management: Businesses can create, assign, and track projects and tasks within the system. Project managers can set deadlines, allocate resources, and track progress in real time.

Resource Allocation: The CMS provides a resource allocation module that helps assign employees to projects and tasks based on their skills and availability.

Timesheets and Attendance: Employees can log their work hours and submit timesheets. The system also tracks attendance and time off, making payroll processing and project cost estimation more straightforward.

Document Repository: The CMS offers a centralized repository to store and organize company documents, making it easy to access project-related policies, procedures, and files.

Reporting and Analytics: Managers can create various reports and analytics to better understand business performance, project progress, and employee productivity.
